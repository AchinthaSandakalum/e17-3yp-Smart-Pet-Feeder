## **Introduction**
When people are getting busy, they forget to take care of their pets even though they love their pets. Taking care of pet's diet can be hard if they want to take good care of pet's health. Smart pet feeder is one of the best solutions for that. It is capable of feeding a pet, in absence of his master. So, though the master is not at home, his pet will not miss his foods.

**Smart pet feeder** can be controlled by using a mobile app or a website. A small camera, which is mounted on the pet feeder, allows the master to see the machine's surrounding and observe the pet's behavior. Master can move the machine remotely while watching through the camera, to find the pet and deliver his foods on time.

If the master is too busy, even to operate it remotely throgh the mobile app or the website, he can switch on the automatic mode and schedule when to give foods. A container that is placed on the machine can be used to store the foods and when the pet is being fed, right amount can be passed to the plate
